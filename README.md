# Actarius lbry browser - An Electron-based browser that can view LBRY URLs.
LBRY content distribution network is dominated by Odysee.com and LBRY desktop app as the main means for content access. 
There are other, minor, solutions like “FastLBRY” which is a terminal-based Linux app. We find this to be insufficient and/or too centralized.
We want to develop a user-friendly, open-source lbry network browser with minimal dependency on any entity that communicates directly with lbry blockchain.
